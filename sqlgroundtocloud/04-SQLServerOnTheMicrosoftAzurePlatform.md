In this section, you'll learn about the different Azure SQL deployment options and service tiers available for Tailspin Toys Gaming, a division of Wide World Importers that focuses on online gameplay. You'll start with understanding Tailspin Toys Gaming's scenario deeper, so you can determine which options are best suited to their business needs.  

### Scenario Review: Tailspin Toys Gaming

Tailspin Toys is the developer of several popular online video games. Founded in 2010, and acquired shortly after by Wide World Importers, the company has experienced exponential growth since releasing the first installment of their most popular game franchise to include online multiplayer gameplay. They have since built upon this success by adding online capabilities to the majority of their game portfolio.

Adding online gameplay has greatly increased popularity of their games, but the rapid increase in demand for their services has made supporting the current setup problematic. To facilitate online gameplay, they host gaming services on-premises using rented hardware. For each game, their gaming services setup consists of three virtual machines running the gaming software and five game databases hosted on a single SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. In addition to the dedicated gaming VMs and databases, they also host authentication and gateway VMs and databases, which are shared by all their games. At its foundation, Tailspin Toys is a game development company, made up primarily of software developers. The few dedicated database and infrastructure resources they do have are struggling to keep up with their ever-increasing workload.

Tailspin Toys is hoping that migrating their services from on-premises to the cloud can help to alleviate some of their infrastructure management issues, while simultaneously helping them to refocus their efforts on delivering business value by releasing new and improved games. They are looking for a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating their gamer information web application and database into the cloud. They maintain their gamer information database, `TailspinToys`, on an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database. This system is used by gamers to update their profiles, view leader boards, purchase game add-ons and more. Since this system helps to drive revenue, it is considered a business-critical application, and needs to be highly-available. They are aware that SQL Server 2008 R2 has reached end of support, and are looking at options for migrating this database into Azure. They have read about some of the advanced security and performance tuning options that are available only in Azure and would prefer to a migrate the database into a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering, if possible. Tailspin Toys is using the Service Broker feature of SQL Server for messaging within the `TailspinToys` database. This functionality is being used for several critical processes, and they cannot afford to lose this capability when migrating their operations database to the cloud. They have also stated that, at this time, they do not have the resources to rearchitect the solution to use an alternative message broker.

### Azure SQL  deployment options

Tailspin Toys has requested your help in determining where and how they should land their data in Azure. This is a decision that all businesses moving to the cloud have to make, and the result will depend on their unique business requirements. Microsoft has recently introduced Azure SQL, which brings all the SQL Server products in Azure under one suite. If you're already familiar with [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/), this slight shift means that Azure SQL also includes [SQL Server on Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/) (also referred to as Azure SQL VMs), which Microsoft is continuously investing in and enhancing the benefits associated with it.  
<!-- TODO: point to Ninar's blog and video when they god live (August 21)-->

There are several different options within Azure SQL, and one visual is shown below.  
 ![Azure SQL Overview](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqllabs/blob/master/graphics/azuresql-overview.png?raw=true)  

> Recently, we announced [Azure SQL Database Instance Pools in preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-instance-pools), which provide a convenient and cost-efficient way to migrate smaller SQL instances to the cloud at scale.   


Every business is going to have unique requirements that make some options better for them than others. There won't necessarily be one 'correct' answer, but there are tradeoffs to consider. Let's look at some examples of Azure SQL customers and what they decided:  

* [**Allscripts**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/allscripts-partner-professional-services-azure): Allscripts is a leading healthcare software manufacturer, serving physician practices, hospitals, health plans, and Big Pharma. To transform its applications frequently and host them securely and reliably, Allscripts wanted to move to Azure quickly. In just three weeks, the company lifted and shifted dozens of acquired applications running on 1,000 virtual machines to Azure with [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/site-recovery/). After the migration to **Azure SQL VMs**, Allscripts began to evaluate and test **Azure SQL Managed Instance**, and started to move some workloads there. 
* [**Komatsu**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/komatsu-australia-manufacturing-azure): Komatsu is a manufacturing company that produces and sells heavy equipment for construction. They had multiple mainframe applications for different types of data, which they wanted to consolidate to get a holistic view. Additionally, they wanted a way reduce overhead. Because Komatsu uses a large surface area of SQL Server features, they chose to move to **Azure SQL Managed Instance**. They were able to move about 1.5 terabytes of data smoothly, and [start enjoying benefits like automatic patching and version updates, automated backups, high availability, and reduced management overhead](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview). After migrating, they reported ~49% cost reduction and ~25-30% performance gains.  
* [**AccuWeather**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/accuweather-partner-professional-services-azure): AccuWeather has been analyzing and predicting the weather for more than 55 years. They wanted access to the rich and rapidly advanced platform of Azure that includes big data, machine learning, and AI capabilities. They want to focus on building new models and applications, not managing databases. They selected **Azure SQL Database [**(single database)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-single-index)** to use with other services, like [Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/) and [Azure Machine Learning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/), to quickly and easily deploy new internal applications to make sales and customer predictions.   
* [**Paychex**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/paychex-azure-sql-database-us): Paychex is a human capital management firm that serves more than 650,000 businesses across the US and Europe. They needed a way to separately manage the time and pay management for each of their businesses, and cut costs. They opted for **Azure SQL Database** [**(elastic pools)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-elastic-pool), which allowed them to simplify the management and enable resource sharing between separate databases to lower costs.  

If you want to dive deeper into the deployment options and how to choose, check out the following resources:  
* [Blog announcement for Azure SQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-SQL-Database/Unified-Azure-SQL-experience/ba-p/815368) which explains and walks through Azure SQL and some of the resulting views and experiences available in the Azure portal.
* [Microsoft Customer Stories](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/home?sq=&ff=&p=0) for many more stories similar to the ones above. You can use this to explore various use cases, industries, and solutions.  
* [Choose the right deployment option in Azure SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-paas-vs-sql-server-iaas) is a page in the documentation regularly updated to help provide insight into making the decisions between the Azure SQL options.
* [Choosing your database migration path to Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/choosing-your-database-migration-path-to-azure/Choosing_your_database_migration_path_to_Azure.pdf) is a white paper that talks about tools for discovering, assessing, planning and migrating SQL databases to Azure. This workshop will refer to it several times, and it's a highly recommended read. Chapter 5 deeply discusses choosing the right deployment option.  
* [Feature comparison between SQL database, SQL managed instance, and SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-features) 
* There are also tools covered later in this module that can help in recommending a deployment option.  


### Azure SQL service tiers and other options

Once you have an understanding of the deployment options, it's time to consider some of the details within the service tiers that are available.  

#### SQL Server on Virtual Machines options

Azure SQL VMs don't have specific service tiers, but there are decisions to be made around which images to choose, how to configure storage and what sizes, etc. This isn't the focus of this workshop, but if you're considering Azure SQL VMs, you'll want to review the [guidance on images to choose from](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-iaas-overview), the [quick checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-sql-performance) to obtain optimal performance of Azure SQL VMs, and the guidance for [storage configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-storage-configuration).  

Recently, [Resource Provider](http://www.aka.ms/sqlvm_rp_documentation) was [announced](http://www.aka.ms/sqlvm_rp), which brings the functionality of Azure Marketplace images to SQL Server instances self-installed on Azure VMs.  

> Note: If you're specifically looking at SQL Server on RHEL Azure VMs, there's a full operations guide available [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/sql-server-on-rhel-azure-vms-operations-guide/
).  
  
> Note: In an earlier module of this workshop, you learned about some of the problems SQL Server is solving. The same applies in an Azure SQL VM.  

#### Azure SQL Database options  

For Azure SQL Database, which is the focus of this module, there are several options and tiers available, and the choices will depend on the scenario.  

There are a few main decisions to be made, which will be explored next.    

*Decision 1: Choose the purchasing model*  
You have two options, [virtual core (vCore)-based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tiers-vcore) (recommended) or [Database transaction unit (DTU)-based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tiers-dtu
).     

The vCore-based model is recommended because it allows you to independently choose compute and storage resources, while the DTU-based model is a bundled measure of compute, storage and I/O resources, which means you have less control over paying only for what you need. This model also allows you to use [Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/) to gain cost savings. In the [vCore model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tiers-vcore), you pay for:  

* Compute resources (the service tier + the number of vCores and the amount of memory + the generation of hardware).
* The type and amount of data and log storage.
* Backup storage ([read-access, geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-designing-ha-apps-with-ragrs)).  

For the purposes of this workshop, we'll focus on the vCore purchasing model (recommended), but you can [compare vCores and DTUs here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-purchase-models
).

*Decision 2: Choose service tier for performance and availability*  
There are three tiers available in the vCore model for Azure SQL Database:
* **[General purpose](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tier-general-purpose)**: Most business workloads. Offers budget-oriented, balanced, and scalable compute and storage options.
* **[Business critical](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tier-business-critical)**: Business applications with low-latency response requirements. Offers highest resilience to failures by using several isolated replicas. This is the only tier that can leverage [in-memory OLTP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-in-memory) to improve performance.
* **[Hyperscale](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tier-hyperscale)**: Most business workloads with highly scalable storage and read-scale requirements. *Currently only available for single databases, not managed instances*.  

A member of the Product Group recently released a [blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/understanding-and-leveraging-azure-sql-database-sla/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7FUNJd5TSE) explaining the SLA (service level agreements that set an expectation for uptime and performance). This resource will help you make an informed decision about which tier to move to.  

For a deeper explanation between the three tiers (including scenarios), you can also refer to the [service-tier characteristics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tiers-vcore#service-tier-characteristics) in the documentation.  

*Decision 3: Provisioned or serverless compute?*  
If you choose **General Purpose within Single databases** and the **vCore-based model**, you have an additional decision to make regarding the compute that you pay for:
* **Provisioned compute** is meant for more regular usage patterns with higher average compute utilization over time, or multiple databases using elastic pools. 
* **Serverless compute** is meant for intermittent, unpredictable usage with lower average compute utilization over time. Serverless has auto-pause and resume capabilities (with a time delay you set), meaning when your database is paused, you only pay for storage.  

For a deeper explanation between the two compute options (including scenarios), you can refer to the detailed [comparison in the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-serverless#comparison-with-provisioned-compute-tier).  

> If you're looking for compute cost saving opportunities, you can prepay for compute resources with [Azure SQL Database reserved capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-reserved-capacity).

*Decision 4: Choose hardware generation*  
The vCore model lets you choose the generation of hardware:  
* **Gen4**: Up to 24 logical CPUs based on Intel E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) 2.4-GHz processors, vCore = 1 PP (physical core), 7 GB per core, attached SSD
* **Gen5**: Up to 80 logical CPUs based on Intel E5-2673 v4 (Broadwell) 2.3-GHz processors, vCore = 1 LP (hyper-thread), 5.1 GB per core, fast eNVM SSD  

Basically, Gen4 hardware offers substantially more memory per vCore. However, Gen5 hardware allows you to scale up compute resources much higher. 

> Note: If you choose General Purpose within Single databases and want to use the serverless compute tier, Gen5 hardware is the only option.  

*Summary*  
As you've hopefully noticed, while there are a lot of options, Azure is able to provide flexibility so you get exactly what you need, nothing less. A summary of the service tier options with some additional considerations is included below, but be sure to check out [pricing information](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/managed/) for the latest details.

![Azure SQL tiers](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqllabs/blob/master/graphics/service-tiers-summary.png?raw=true)


> Note: Data Migration Assistant (covered later in this module) runs scans that can help you choose some of the options as well as the SKU. [Learn more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/dma/dma-sku-recommend-sql-db?view=sql-server-2017).

Tailspin Toys Gaming is leaning towards Azure SQL Managed Instance, because it supports movement to Azure without changing the database features that are used (in this case, Service Broker). They think business critical is the right tier for them, as they need to maximize performance and availability. By using the vCore-based model, they're able to leverage their existing investments with Azure Hybrid Benefits (1 Enterprise license core for SQL Server = 1 Business Critical vCore). Additionally, they want to leverage the three replicas provided free with business critical, where one can be used for [read scale-out](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-read-scale-out), that is needed as the game experiences heavy read workloads.

Before Tailspin Toys Gaming commits to moving to Azure SQL Managed Instance, they want to understand some of the benefits that come with running their SQL workloads in Azure.    
  

In this section, we will highlight some of the key benefits of choosing Azure for your SQL workloads. If you want to go deeper, additional reference information is available.    
   


Azure SQL Database (including single databases, elastic pools, and managed instances) is a fully managed Database Engine that automates most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring. Some of the built-in capabilities include:  
* [Business continuity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-business-continuity) enables your business to continue operating in the face of disruption, particularly to its computing infrastructure.
* [High availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-high-availability) of Azure SQL Database guarantees your databases are up and running 99.99% of the time, no need to worry about maintenance/downtimes.
* [Automated backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups) are created and use Azure read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) to provide geo-redundancy.
* [Long term backup retention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-long-term-retention) enables you to store specific full databases for up to 10 years.
* [Geo-replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-active-geo-replication) by creating readable replicas of your database in the same or different data center (region).
* [Scale](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-scale-resources) by easily adding more resources (CPU, memory, storage) without long provisioning.
* Network Security
    * [Azure SQL Database (single database and elastic pool)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-security-overview#network-security) provides firewalls to prevent network access to the database server until access is explicitly granted based on IP address or Azure Virtual Network traffic origin.
    * [Azure SQL Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-connectivity-architecture) has an extra layer of security in providing native virtual network implementation and connectivity to your on-premises environment using [Azure ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/) or [VPN Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways).
* [Advanced security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-security-index) detects threats and vulnerabilities in your databases and enables you to secure your data.
* [Automatic tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automatic-tuning) analyzes your workload and provides you the recommendations that can optimize performance of your applications by adding indexes, removing unused indexes, and automatically fixing the query plan issues.
* [Built-in monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-sql) capabilities enable you to get the insights into performance of your databases and workload, and troubleshoot the performance issues.
* [Built-in intelligence](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-intelligent-insights) automatically identifies the potential issues in your workload and provides you the recommendations that can [help you to fix the problems](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/ai-helped-troubleshoot-an-intermittent-sql-database-performance-issue-in-one-day/). 

> Note: Many benefits typically thought of as Platform as a Service (PaaS) are surfacing in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). You can learn more about automated updates, automated backups, high availability, and performance provided in Azure SQL VMs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-iaas-overview).  

In addition to the resources linked to above, several [slide decks](https://aka.ms/azuresqlslides) are available (with notes and animations) that you can review to learn more. You can also check out the [Core Cloud Services - Azure architecture and service guarantees](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-azure-infrastructure/) module from Microsoft Learn.

Tailspin Toys has spent some time with you learning more about the benefits of Azure SQL. Based on their research, they've decided to migrate the Tailspin Toys database to Azure as a PoC for migrating larger workloads.  

The general process for [migrating assets to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/getting-started/migrate) (whether it's apps, infrastructure, or data) is as follows:  
* **Assess**: Evaluate an existing asset and establish a plan for migration of the asset.
* **Migrate**: Replicate the functionality of an asset in the cloud.
* **Optimize**: Balance the performance, cost, access, and operational capacity of a cloud asset.
* **Secure and manage**: Ensure a cloud asset is ready for ongoing operations.


In guiding Tailspin Toys through the *data* migration journey, it's helpful to leverage the following process that is specific to data:  
![Data migration process](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqllabs/blob/master/graphics/data-migration-process.png?raw=true)   

Below you'll find a detailed survey of some of the resources and tips available for going through each phase of the migration journey to Azure (you can find a [full list of tools based on phase and target here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dms/dms-tools-matrix)). The number of resources shows the dedication Microsoft and partners have to helping you move successfully to the cloud.  

In an effort to simplify, we recommend using the [Data migration guide](https://datamigration.microsoft.com/) which allows you to pick your source and target, and then guides you step-by-step through your specific migration journey.  

Additionally, you can check out the [Azure migration center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/migration/) which includes detailed information about the migration journey, and the [Azure Migrate Program (AMP)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/migration/migration-program/) where you can get support, migration partners, webinars, and more.  

With your help, Tailspin Toys Gaming decided to apply for the Azure Migrate Program, to get support and guidance from Microsoft and partners. Then, they leveraged the integration of Azure Migrate, Data Migration Assistant, and Azure Database Migration Service to migrate their databases.  

Once the Tailspin Toys Gaming division has migrated to Azure, the overall corporation may choose to scale the migration to Azure. In that case, [refer to guidance here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/migrate/azure-best-practices/contoso-migration-scale
).
 

Below, you'll find a reference chart that explains each step in the three-phase process following the diagram above. Each phase contains steps with descriptions and helpful resources. *This chart is not meant to be consumed in its entirety here, but feel free to follow what is interesting or relevant to your needs, or refer back to it later*.

In this series of hands-on labs (throughout Modules 4 and 5), you will implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database into Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI). You will perform assessments to reveal any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database and the managed database offerings in Azure. You will then migrate the customer's on-premises gamer information, web application and database into Azure, with minimal to no down-time. Finally, you will enable some of the advanced SQL features available in SQL MI to improve security and performance in the customer's application.

At the end of these hands-on labs, you will be better able to implement a cloud migration solution for business-critical applications and databases.  

> **Note**: These labs were modified from an existing day-long, hands-on-labs workshop to fit into this workshop. If you'd like to access the extended version of these labs refer to [MCW: Migrating SQL databases to Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure).



## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture that Tailspin Toys decided to go with, and what you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a virtual network containing SQL MI in a isolated subnet, along with a JumpBox VM and Database Migration Service in a management subnet. The MI Subnet displays both the primary managed instance, along with a read-only replica, which is accessed by reports from the web app. The web app connects to SQL MI via a subnet gateway and point-to-site VPN. The web app is published to App Services using Visual Studio. An online data migration is conducted from the on-premises SQL Server to SQL MI using the Azure Database Migration Service, which reads backup files from an SMB network share.](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqllabs/blob/master/graphics/preferred-solution-architecture.png?raw=true "Preferred Solution diagram")

Throughout the solution, you will use [Azure Migrate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-services-overview) as the central hub to track the discovery, assessment, and migration of Tailspin Toys. The solution begins with using the [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=sql-server-2017) to perform assessments of feature parity and compatibility of the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database against both Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB) and Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI), with the goal of migrating the `TailspinToys` database into an Azure PaaS offering with minimal or no changes. After completing the assessments and reviewing the findings, the SQL Server 2008 R2 database is migrated into SQL MI using the Azure Database Migration Service's online data migration option. This allows the database to be migrated with little to no downtime, by using a backup and transaction logs stored in an SMB network share.  

They'll also leverage their existing licenses to get [Azure Hybrid Benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/), and they'll prepay for [reserved capacity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-general-availability-of-azure-sql-database-reserved-capacity/
). This will help them save money from the start.  

The web app is deployed to an Azure App Service Web App using Visual Studio. Once the database has been migrated and cutover, the `TailspinToysWeb` application is configured to talk to the SQL MI VNet through a virtual network gateway using [point-to-site VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about), and its connection strings are updated to point to the new SQL MI database.  

>**Note**: Due to time constraints, the lab will deal with switching the app running on a Jumpbox VM locally from leveraging data in SQL Server 2008 to SQL MI (but not the deployment to Azure or integrating the App Service with the Virtual Network). In the [extended version of these labs](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/HOL%20step-by-step%20-%20Migrating%20SQL%20databases%20to%20Azure.md#exercise-3-update-the-web-application-to-use-the-new-sql-mi-database), or if you have time at the end of the lab, you can do that.  

Once in SQL MI, several features of Azure SQL Database are examined. [Advanced Data Security (ADS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-advanced-data-security?view=sql-server-2017) is enabled and [Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-data-discovery-and-classification?view=sql-server-2017) is used to better understand the data and potential compliance issues with data in the database. The ADS [Vulnerability Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment?view=sql-server-2017) is used to identify potential security vulnerabilities and issues in the database, and those finding are used to mitigate one finding by enabling [Transparent Data Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql?view=sql-server-2017) in the database. [Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking?view=sql-server-2017) is used to prevent sensitive data from appearing when querying the database. Finally, [Read Scale-out](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-read-scale-out) is used to point reports on the Tailspin Toys web app to a read-only secondary, allowing reporting, particularly for the Leaderboard statistics page, to occur without impacting the performance of the primary database.

In these activities, you'll set up Azure Migrate, and explore some of the new integrations between Microsoft's Data Migration Assistant (DMA) and Azure Database Migration Services (DMS). Before you begin the assessments, you need to restore a copy of the `TailspinToys` database in your SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. Finally, you will use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform an assessment of the `TailspinToys` database against Azure SQL Database (Single database and Managed Instance). The assessment will provide a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the various services.   

To complete the activities for this module, proceed directly to the Activities in [**Lab: Database Discovery and Assessment for Migrating to Azure**](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqllabs/blob/master/Lab-DatabaseDiscoveryAndAssessmentForMigratingToAzure.md) for the hands-on exercises for Tailspin Toys Gaming. When are you done with these activities, come back here and continue to Module 5.
